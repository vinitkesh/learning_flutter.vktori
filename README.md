## 2. Introduction
- I think a very good intro to flutter (or most other softwares) is a good ol fireship video
- As always i started with [Flutter in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhRhPV--G0&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiQYtnn1TZ6U0Ec_vjCN9VY&index=18)
- Also [Dart in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrO0CJCbYLA&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiQYtnn1TZ6U0Ec_vjCN9VY&index=21)
- Shush! Dont speak a word: Here, have [this](https://teraboxapp.com/s/1A2qoFDsyF49etBmnDRrmOg). You're welcome.
